## Note

- The 'All Countries' screen in the application requires the data to be downloaded by using the "Download" option in the "More" page.
- You can search the city by two ways , one by providing only the city name (eg: "Norway") , the second option is by providing both city as well as country name (eg: "Norway, NO"). By this way, you can be more precise in searching the weather of a location.
